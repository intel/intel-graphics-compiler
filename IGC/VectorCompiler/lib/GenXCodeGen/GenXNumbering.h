//
/// GenXNumbering
/// -------------
///
/// GenXNumbering is an analysis that provides a numbering of the instructions
/// for use by live ranges.
///
/// The numbering is done such that slots are reserved for where GenXCoalescing
/// might need to insert copies.
///
/// Generally, an instruction gets a slot in the numbering for itself, and
/// another slot just before, in case it is a two address instruction where
/// GenXCoalescing might want to insert a copy.
///
/// Every instruction gets a number, even if it is baled in. However, for the
/// purposes of live range segments, every instruction in a bale is assumed
/// to have the same number as the head instruction of the bale.
///
/// A non-intrinsic call has N slots reserved
/// before it for pre-copies, where N is the number of SimpleValues in the
/// (possibly struct) args, allowing for extra args that might be added later by
/// GenXArgIndirection.
/// 
/// Similarly, a non-intrinsic call has N slots reserved after it for
/// post-copies, where N is the number of SimpleValues in the (possibly struct)
/// return value. The definition of each SimpleValue in the result of the call
/// is considered to be in its slot, and the corresponding SimpleValue in the
/// unified return value has an extra segment of live range from the call up to
/// that slot.
/// 
/// A return instruction in a subroutine has N slots reserved before it for
/// pre-copies, where N is the number of SimpleValues in the (possibly struct)
/// return value. The use of each SimpleValue in the return is considered to be
/// in its slot, and the corresponding SimpleValue in the unified return value
/// has an extra segment of live range from the slot up to the return.
///
/// A kernel has a slot for each kernel arg copy. A copy is inserted into such a slot in
/// GenXCoalescing if the kernel arg offset is not aligned enough for the uses
/// of the value.
///
/// **IR restriction**: After this pass, it is very difficult to modify code
/// other than by inserting copies in the reserved slots above, as it would
/// disturb the numbering.
