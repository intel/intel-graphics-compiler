## Opcode

  MUL = 0x10

## Format

| | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0x10(MUL) | Exec_size | Pred | Dst | Src0 | Src1 |


## Semantics




                    for (i = 0; < exec_size; ++i){
                      if (ChEn[i]) {
                        dst[n] = src0[i] * src1[i];
                      }
                    }

## Description


    Performs component-wise multiplication of <src0> and <src1> and stores the result into <dst>.

- **Exec_size(ub):** Execution size
 
  - Bit[2..0]: size of the region for source and destination operands
 
    - 0b000:  1 element (scalar) 
    - 0b001:  2 elements 
    - 0b010:  4 elements 
    - 0b011:  8 elements 
    - 0b100:  16 elements 
    - 0b101:  32 elements 
  - Bit[7..4]: execution mask (explicit control over the enabled channels)
 
    - 0b0000:  M1 
    - 0b0001:  M2 
    - 0b0010:  M3 
    - 0b0011:  M4 
    - 0b0100:  M5 
    - 0b0101:  M6 
    - 0b0110:  M7 
    - 0b0111:  M8 
    - 0b1000:  M1_NM 
    - 0b1001:  M2_NM 
    - 0b1010:  M3_NM 
    - 0b1011:  M4_NM 
    - 0b1100:  M5_NM 
    - 0b1101:  M6_NM 
    - 0b1110:  M7_NM 
    - 0b1111:  M8_NM
- **Pred(uw):** Predication control

- **Dst(vec_operand):** The destination operand. Operand class: general,indirect

- **Src0(vec_operand):** The first source operand. Operand class: general,indirect,immediate

- **Src1(vec_operand):** The second source operand. Operand class: general,indirect,immediate

#### Properties
- **Supported Types:** B,D,DF,F,HF,UB,UD,UW,W 
- **Saturation:** Yes 
- **Source Modifier:** arithmetic
